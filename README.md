Your challenge is to build the back end for an e-commerce site. Youâ€™ll take a working Express.js API and configure it to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.
<br>

## **Description**
The objective of this challenge is to create a functioning database that can be interacted with using the GET, POST, PUT and DELETE routes. We start with some starter code but must complete the code to make it fully functional.  Once the code is completed, we are able to successfully create, update and delete data from our ecommerce database.

## Installation
You must have node.js installed on your system.<br>
You can run [npm install] to install all the required npm packages.<br>
The packages that will be imported are:
    <br>&emsp;1) MYSQL2
    <br>&emsp;2) EXPRESS
    <br>&emsp;3) SEQUELIZE
    <br>&emsp;4) DOTENV
    <br>&emsp;5) NODEMON
<br>

## Usage

<br>A demo of the application can be viewed here:

<br>The source code for the application can be viewed here:
<br>https://github.com/jk377y/hope-is-lost-ecomm-backend

<br>
To start the program, open the command terminal from the root directory.
<br>
First we need to login, access and use our database:

<br>
Next we will need to provide some initial data by seeding the database:
<br><br>

<br>
Then we will need to connect to our server by typing [npm run watch]:
<br><br>

<br><br>
Once connected, you will be able to access/edit the database through route commands by using Insomnia
<br><br>
The GET route will retreive data from the database.
<br><br>
<img src="./images/getRoute.JPG" alt="screenshot of using a GET route in Insomnia" width=800px>
<br><br>
The POST route will add data to the database.
<br><br>
<img src="./images/postRoute.JPG" alt="screenshot of using a POST route in Insomnia" width=800px>
<br><br>
The PUT route will allow you to change data in the database that already exists.
<br><br>
<img src="./images/putRoute.JPG" alt="screenshot of using a PUT route in Insomnia" width=800px>
<br><br>
The DELETE route will allow you to delete data from the database.
<br><br>
